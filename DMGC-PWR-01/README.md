*Note: This image shows v2.0. There is minimal difference between this and v2.3.*

The PWR board has gone through a few iterations. Because the system will run with 4x AA batteries or the DC jack input, the range of input voltages is relatively wide - anywhere between ~4 V up to ~8 V, plus margin. The output voltage must be maintained at 5 V. The logical choice would be a buck-boost converter. Thus, the DMGC-PWR-01 utilizes the TPS630702 (or TPS63070 or TPS630701) â€“ a buck-boost converter with only a few external parts required for operation, that accepts anywhere between 2 V and 16 V to produce a 5 V output.

This board is likely the most complex part of the build. I spent a lot of time tuning the circuit to produce the exact results I wanted with ample protection downstream of the converters.

For a technical explanation of the CPU board, please view the README in the Technical folder.

## Board Characteristics
The zipped folder contains all the gerber files for this board.
-	Layers: 2
-	Thickness: 1.2 mm or smaller
-	Surface Finish: ENIG or HASL

*HASL is acceptable, but might introduce a bit of difficulty soldering the QFN chip owing to the possibly uneven surface compared to an ENIG finish.*

You can alternatively use the zipped folder at any board fabricator you like. You may also buy the board from PCBWay using this link (disclosure: I receive 10% of the sale value to go towards future PCB orders):

## Using in an Original DMG (UNTESTED!)

This board can (probably) be used as a replacement to the original DMG power board, provided you are using an IPS screen that only requires a 5 V output. This board will not supply voltages for the LCD, so it cannot be used in an unmodded DMG.

Follow the silkscreen on the back of the board to connect wires to the DMG motherboard, as shown below (image from Gekkio's Game Boy Hardware Database: https://gbhwdb.gekkio.fi/consoles/dmg/). The red wire on the main DMG CPU board indicates pin 1. The blue box on the back of the DMG CPU board indicates the connection for the BAT hole.

IF you happen to test this (at your own risk!) let me know your results.
